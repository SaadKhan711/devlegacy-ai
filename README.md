What it Does
DevLegacy AI is a full-stack web application designed to help developers learn from their own code. Users can paste in code snippets, and the app leverages the Google Gemini API to provide an instant, in-depth analysis.

‚ú® Features
AI-Powered Analysis: Get a plain English explanation of what your code does, suggestions for improvement, and best practices.

Automatic Unit Tests: Instantly generate JUnit tests for your Java code to ensure quality and robustness.

Personal Code History: Every analysis is saved to a personal, searchable history, creating an intelligent code diary that grows with you.

Secure Authentication: User accounts and data are kept safe and private with Auth0.
